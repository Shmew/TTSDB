# Fable.SignalR

Fable.SignalR is bindings for Microsoft's javascript SignalR [client].

The library has been developed to follow the native API as 
closely as possible, while taking some librerties for type-safety
and usability.

Everything to get started is accessible from the `SignalR` module once
you've opened `Fable.SignalR`.
