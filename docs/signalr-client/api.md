## SignalR

Main entry point.

The full type restrictions for a [HubConnection](#hubconnection) and [HubConnectionBuilder](#hubconnectionbuilder) are:
 * `'ClientApi` - Sent **to** the server for `send` and `invoke`.
 * `'ClientStreamFromApi` - Sent **to** the server for `streamFrom`.
 * `'ClientStreamToApi` - Sent **to** the server for `streamTo`.
 * `'ServerApi` - Sent **from** the server in response to `send` and `invoke`.
 * `'ServerStreamApi` - Sent **from** the server in response to `streamFrom`.

These are aliased as `<Types>` for readability:

### SignalR.connect`<Types>`

Starts a connection to a SignalR hub.

Signature:
```fsharp
(config: HubConnectionBuilder<Types> -> HubConnectionBuilder<Types>) -> HubConnection<Types> 
```

### SignalR.httpClient

Signature:
```fsharp
ILogger -> Http.DefaultClient
```

### SignalR.logger

Creates an ILogger from a logging function.

Signature:
```fsharp
(handler: LogLevel -> string -> unit) -> ILogger
```

### SignalR.nullLogger

Gets an instance of the NullLogger.

Signature:
```fsharp

```
### SignalR.subject`<'T>`

```

## Elmish

All of the commands are in the `Cmd.SignalR` namespace.

### baseUrl

Returns the base url of the hub connection.

Signature:
```fsharp
(hub: #Elmish.Hub<'ClientApi,'ServerApi> option) (msg: string -> 'Msg) : Cmd<'Msg>
```

### connectionId

    -> Elmish.HubConnectionBuilder<'ClientApi,unit,unit,'ServerApi,unit,'Msg>) : Cmd<'Msg>
```

### attempt

Invokes a hub method on the server and maps the error.

This method resolves when the server indicates it has finished invoking the method. When it finishes, 
the server has finished invoking the method. If the server method returns a result, it is produced as the result of
resolving the async call.

Signature:
```fsharp
(hub: #Elmish.Hub<'ClientApi,'ServerApi> option) 
(msg: 'ClientApi) 
(onError: exn -> 'Msg) : Cmd<'Msg>
```
### either

Invokes a hub method on the server and maps the success or error.

This method resolves when the server indicates it has finished invoking the method. When it finishes, 
the server has finished invoking the method. If the server method returns a result, it is produced as the result of
resolving the async call.

Signature:
```fsharp
(hub: #Elmish.Hub<'ClientApi,'ServerApi> option) 
(msg: 'ClientApi) 
(onSuccess: 'ServerApi -> 'Msg) 
(onError: exn -> 'Msg) : Cmd<'Msg>
```

### perform

Invokes a hub method on the server and maps the success.

This method resolves when the server indicates it has finished invoking the method. When it finishes, 
the server has finished invoking the method. If the server method returns a result, it is produced as the result of
resolving the async call.

Signature:
```fsharp
(hub: #Elmish.Hub<'ClientApi,'ServerApi> option) 
(msg: 'ClientApi) 
(onSuccess: 'ServerApi -> 'Msg) : Cmd<'Msg>

This method resolves when the client has sent the invocation to the server. The server may still
be processing the invocation.

Signature:
```fsharp
(hub: #Elmish.Hub<'ClientApi,'ServerApi> option) (msg: 'ClientApi) : Cmd<'Msg>
```

```

## Feliz

The api exposed from the Feliz extension package is quite simple:

```fsharp
React.useSignalR<Types> (config: HubConnectionBuilder -> HubConnectionBuilder) -> Hub
```

The type of builder depends on the type restrictions given to `useSignalR`:
* No streaming - React.useSignalR<'ClientApi,'ServerApi>
* Client streaming - React.useSignalRReact.useSignalR<'ClientApi,'ClientStreamApi,'ServerApi>
* Server streaming - React.useSignalRReact.useSignalR<'ClientApi,'ClientStreamApi,'ServerApi,'ServerStreamApi>
* Bidirectional streaming - React.useSignalRReact.useSignalR<'ClientApi,'ClientStreamFromApi,'ClientStreamToApi,'ServerApi,'ServerStreamApi>

    /// The target methods stream IDs.
    abstract streamIds: ResizeArray<string> option
```

### StreamItemMessage

A hub message representing a single item produced as part of a result stream.

Signature:
```fsharp
type StreamItemMessage<'T> =
    inherit HubInvocationMessage

    /// A MessageType value indicating the type of this message.
    abstract ``type``: MessageType
        
    /// A MessageHeaders dictionary containing headers attached to the message.
    abstract headers: Map<string,string> option

    /// The ID of the invocation relating to this message.
    abstract invocationId: string

    /// The item produced by the server.
    abstract item: 'T
```

### CompletionMessage

A hub message representing the result of an invocation.

Signature:
```fsharp
type CompletionMessage<'T> =
    inherit HubInvocationMessage

    /// A MessageType value indicating the type of this message.
    abstract ``type``: MessageType
        
    /// A MessageHeaders dictionary containing headers attached to the message.
    abstract headers: Map<string,string> option

    /// The invocation ID.
    abstract invocationId: string

    /// The error produced by the invocation, if any.
    /// 
    /// Either CompletionMessage.error or CompletionMessage.result must be defined, but not both.
    abstract error: string option

    /// The result produced by the invocation, if any.
    /// 
    /// Either CompletionMessage.error or CompletionMessage.result must be defined, but not both.
    abstract result: 'T option
```

### PingMessage

A hub message indicating that the sender is still active.

Signature:
```fsharp
type PingMessage =
    inherit HubMessageBase

    /// A MessageType value indicating the type of  message.
    abstract ``type``: MessageType
```

### CloseMessage

A hub message indicating that the sender is closing the connection.

If CloseMessage.error is defined, the sender is closing the connection due to an error.

Signature:
```fsharp
type CloseMessage =
    inherit HubMessageBase

    /// A MessageType value indicating the type of this message.
    abstract ``type``: MessageType

    /// The error that triggered the close, if any.
    /// 
    /// If this property is undefined, the connection was closed normally and without error.
    abstract error: string option

    /// If true, clients with automatic reconnects enabled should attempt to reconnect after 
    /// receiving the CloseMessage. Otherwise, they should not.
    abstract allowReconnect: bool option
```

### CancelInvocationMessage

A hub message sent to request that a streaming invocation be canceled.

Signature:
```fsharp
type CancelInvocationMessage =
        inherit HubInvocationMessage

    /// A MessageType value indicating the type of this message.
    abstract ``type``: MessageType
        
    /// A MessageHeaders dictionary containing headers attached to the message.
    abstract headers: Map<string,string> option

    /// The ID of the invocation relating to this message.
    /// 
    /// This is expected to be present for StreamInvocationMessage and CompletionMessage. It may
    /// be 'undefined' for an InvocationMessage if the sender does not expect a response.
    abstract invocationId: string option
```

### HubMessage

Signature:
```fsharp
type HubMessage<'StreamInvocation,'Args,'Completion,'StreamItem> =
    U8<InvocationMessage<'Args>, 
        InvocationMessage<InvokeArg<'Args>>, 
        StreamItemMessage<'StreamItem>, 
        CompletionMessage<'Completion>, 
        StreamInvocationMessage<'StreamInvocation>, 
        CancelInvocationMessage, 
        PingMessage, 
        CloseMessage>
```
