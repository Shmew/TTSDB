# TTSDB

A Discord bot that reads out what users say in a specified text channel if they're also present in a voice channel (for example if someone has no microphone).

### How To Run It

* Set the `TTSDB_Discord` and `TTSDB_Azure` environment variables for the Discord bot API key and Azure Speech resource respectively.
* Fill in the `GuildId`, `TextChannelId`, and (optionally) any user substitutions you want.
